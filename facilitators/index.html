            Wende Clarence Safari is a final year PhD student in statistics at the University of A Coruña, Spain. The title of her thesis is “Nonparametric inference for the mixture cure model when the cure status is partially known”.  Her work contributes to the state-of-the-art in time-to-event data, as it extends previous methods in survival analysis and regression models. Her previous training was in Tanzania and Belgium, where she did a bachelor degree in Applied Statistics at Mzumbe University (Tanzania) and a Master's degree in (Bio)statistics at Hasselt University (Belgium). Prior to starting her PhD, she worked with the National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR), Mwanza in Tanzania. Later, she received a research grant from the HIV Research Trust, UK, where she visited and worked at the Africa Health Research Institute (AHRI) in South Africa. She has worked in several other medical and statistical research environments in Spain and has spent time in HIV and TB research working groups in Tanzania and South Africa, respectively. She contributed  and supervised many students from different backgrounds. Her research interests include but are not limited to: developing and applying complex survival analysis models (cure models) to medical datasets, modelling missing data analysis methods, and regression modelling. She can be contacted at wende.safari@udc.es
